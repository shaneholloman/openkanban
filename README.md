## Why?

AI coding agents are powerful, but managing multiple agents across projects gets messy fast. You end up with terminals everywhere, losing track of what's running where, and context-switching between tasks becomes a chore.

OpenKanban gives you a single view of all your work. Each ticket gets its own git worktree and embedded terminal. Spawn an agent, watch it work, jump between tasks. Everything stays organized.

## Features

- **Tickets as worktrees** - Each task gets an isolated git branch
- **Embedded terminals** - Agents run inside the TUI, not in random terminal tabs
- **Any agent** - OpenCode, Claude Code, Aider, or whatever CLI tool you prefer
- **Multi-project** - Manage tickets across all your repositories from one board

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install TechDufus/tap/openkanban

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/techdufus/openkanban@latest
